So this is a page of notes as I'm going through making this app. I'm making this app to get practice with flutter, and get used to the widgets before jumping into bigger projects. Also, I've never made a game before so this will be a nice change of pace from the more utilitarian apps I've made so far. 

First off, I'm following this tutorial on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRz1ICq5mNx8tYouCq1Qd9bRjnYxoCuWH

9/13/22: Almost completely moved on from the project. I was frustrated by the changing aspect ratio messing everything upp. Switching bewtween landscape and portrait completely destroyed the layout. I'm exagerrating because it does work, it's just that everything is ugly. The boxes are rectangles and whatnot. I found out that Flutter has a freakin aspect ratio widget. So I just wrapped the main part of the screen with that widget and centered it. Then boom! Everything is a nice 16:9 aspect ratio regardless. I think this is similar to legit wordle because the desktop verion has a lot of whitespace on the left and right of the game board. This is the biggest deviation/improvement I've made from the tutorial so far. He's building on a phone emulator so no changing aspect ratio. I think this change is just a simple improvement.
